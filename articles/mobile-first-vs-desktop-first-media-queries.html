				Quick Summary: Mobile first media queries use <code>min-width</code> and desktop first media queries use <code>max-width</code>
			</p>

			<p class="content-paragraph">
				<span class="drop-caps">M</span>edia queries in CSS allow to you specify style rules that apply only to specific screen sizes. This is a great way to achieve responsive design and is how many grid-based CSS libraries (such as Bootstrap) achieve responsiveness. Since we are typically worried about screen width, there are two important media query rules that apply: <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-width</code>.
			</p>

			<p class="content-paragraph">The difference between desktop-first and media-first media queries lies in how any CSS rules that are not inside of a <code>@media</code> block are treated. In desktop-first mode, these rules apply only to the largest screens. In mobile-first mode they apply to the smallest screens.

			<p class="content-paragraph-title">Desktop-First Media Queries</p>
			<p class="content-paragraph">Below is an example of stylesheet written with desktop-first media queries. Notice how it uses <code>max-width</code> rules.
<pre><code>

...
// all rules outside of @media queries apply to devices 1201px and above
...

@media (max-width: 1200px) {
	...
	// rules here apply to devices from 993px to 1200px (inclusive)
	...
}
@media (max-width: 992px) {	
	...
	// rules here apply to devices from 769px to 992px (inclusive)
	...
}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
	...
	// rules here apply to devices from 0px to 768px (inclusive)
	...
}
</code></pre>
			</p>

			<p class="content-paragraph-title">Mobile-First Media Queries</p>
			<p class="content-paragraph">Below is an example of stylesheet written with mobile-first media queries. Notice how it uses <code>min-width</code> rules.
<pre><code>

...
// all rules outside of @media queries apply to devices from 0px to 767px (inclusive)
...

@media (min-width: 768px) {
	...
	// rules here apply to devices from from 768px to 991px (inclusive)
	...
}
@media (min-width: 992px) {	
	...
	// rules here apply to devices from 992px to 1199px (inclusive)
	...
}
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
	...
	// rules here apply to devices 1200px and greater
	...
}
</code></pre>

			<p class="content-paragraph-title">Which one should you use?</p>
			<p class="content-paragraph">
				As the names suggest, mobile-first media queries are better for mobile centric design and vice-versa. This is again due to how the rules "outside" of the <code>@media</code> blocks are treated. If you are expecting your mobile designs to be more complex, mobile-first media queries are better because most of your rules will apply to mobile screens, and you will just be "modifying" the base design for larger screens.
			</p>
			
			<p class="content-paragraph">
				If you expect your desktop design to be more complex, it is better to use desktop-first media queries. Your base CSS rules
				will apply to large screens by default and you will just be "modifying" this base template on progressively smaller screens.
