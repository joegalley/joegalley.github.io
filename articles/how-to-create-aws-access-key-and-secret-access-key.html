    1. Log Into the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">AWS Console</a>
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph-sub-title">
    2. Go to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credential">AWS security credentials page</a>
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph" style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    If there's a popup, click "Continue to Security Credentials"
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph-sub-title">
    3. Expand the "Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)" section
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph-sub-title">
    4. Click "Create New Access Key"
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph" style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    If "Create New Access Key" is greyed out, it means you already have the maximum of 2 access keys. You will need to
    click "Delete" next to an existing access key so that you have at most one access key. Note that even if a key is
    marked as "Inactive", it still counts against the maximum of 2 access keys. Also note that you will never be able
    to use an access key after you delete it, and any requests made with that key will fail.
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph-sub-title">
    5. Click "Show Access Key" to see your new Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
</p>

<p class="content-paragraph" style="margin-left: 3rem;">
    This is the only time you'll ever be able to see the Secret Access Key. Copy it and store it some place safe. You
    can also download the key as a CSV by clicking the "Download Key File" button.
