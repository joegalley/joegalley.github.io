				<b>Quick Summary: Extend <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code> and implement <code>configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth</code>.</b>
			</p>


			<p>
				<span class="drop-caps">I</span>n memory authentication allows you to quickly set up a simple way
				to authenticate users in your Spring Boot application. It creates a thin layer of security and allows
                you to prototype a security-aware application without setting up a full database. You can manage all
                aspects of authentication and authorization - including login credentials, roles, and authorities -
                with in-memory authentication.
			</p	>
			<p>
				To set up in-memory authentication in our app, we are going to extend the <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code>
                class. There are two methods that we are going to override, but they both are named <code>configure</code>.
                As these are overloaded methods, they take different parameters. The first one that we are going to
                implement is one that takes <code>HttpSecurity http</code>
