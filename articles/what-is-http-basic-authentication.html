    your own social media profiles and only you should be able to access your bank account information. Nearly all
    websites include at least a username/password combination as access control for private pages. End users will typically
    only need to enter their username and password once during a session and all other pages they visit will automatically
    be available. This is made possible by servers storing the user's session. However, if you are not interacting with a
    website or web service through a browser - such as making calls to its API - you will need to authenticate each request
    individually.

<p>There are many different ways to do authentication over HTTP. The most "basic" way is
    to use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme. If a server is requesting the user to use Basic authentication, it will
    typically show a popup that looks like this:



    It is as simple as including an <code>Authorization</code> header in
    the request containing a username and password. However there is a specific format required by basic authentication:
    the username and password must be concatenated with a colon (<code>:</code>) in between, and this value must be
    base64 encoded. For example, if my username is <code>foo</code> and my password is <code>password123</code>, then we
    must combine these to look be <code>foo:password123</code>.  Then we must base64 encode this entire value, which becomes
    <code>Zm9vOnBhc3N3b3JkMTIz</code>. So to use Basic authentication for this requests, the header will look like:
