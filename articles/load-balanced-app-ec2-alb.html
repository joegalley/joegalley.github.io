<p class="content-paragraph"><span class="drop-caps">A</span>WS makes it easy to get an application up and running
    quickly
    on an EC2 instance. And what's better than running your app on an EC2 instance? Running your app on two (or more)
    EC2
    instances! Running an application on multiple servers gives you more availability when there's a spike in traffic,
    and more resilience since one instance going down won't bring down the whole application. The common pattern for
    running an application on multiple EC2 instances in AWS is by putting the instances behind a load balancer. The load
    balancer handles all requests and routes them to an EC2 instance. In this article, I will show you how to create a
    load-balanced application running on three EC2 instance behind an AWS Application Load Balancer.

<p class="content-paragraph">
    First, I'll explain how to create the load-balanced environment using the AWS CLI. This can be tedious but it should
    give you a deep understanding off all the steps AWS goes through when it creates the environment. Second, I'll
    explain
    how to achieve the same result using CloudFormation. This way is easier (once you understand the underlying
    operations)
    and it gives you the benefits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as
    Code</a>. CloudFormation is the better option if you were to set this up in a real enterprise environment.
